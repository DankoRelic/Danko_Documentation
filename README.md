This will be the main descriptive and directive index for my projects.
The files and folders contained within this repository should help direct you towards the project that you are seeking.
I'm not really sure where this journey will take me, but I look forward to the ride.


My ULTIMATE project list:

1. A universal standard for ('POP' "Picture Oblong Picture"). A proposed technogolgy that would be contained in televisions and higher end laptops, or all-in-ones, but not limited to any connected technology with hardware limited features. This techology will be based upon the primary target of individual multi control of multiple simultaneous input instances. Up to four separate instances on one single viewable display, each with indepentent audio routing control over to a connectected bluetooth or dlna compatible device. Not really going for anything fancy here but with our technology, there's no reason for us all to not share a television and still be in the same room. There's all kinds of features already requested and we'll see if we get any interest in building a television platform from scratch. It's going to be fun and I plan on working on it anyway.
2. I am a musician that's working on a new project for a web interface/server type of deal. I'm just now getting back into writing phase and recordings are soon to follow. I plan om promoting thereafter and I'm looking to create some cool shit for the online.

I'm still new to coding so bear with me. I do look forward to meeting those of you that want to jump in on this.

Danko
